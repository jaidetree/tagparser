# HTML Unclosed Tag Finder

This is an open source ruby script written to parse a file containing HTML and report any unclosed tags.                                                                                                                

## Why

This seemed like a good, fun little weekend project. I found when looking at HTML files for my template partials they would often be missing a random closing tag and so a basic CLI utitlity to find them seemed quite useful.

## How

Supply in the location of a text file containing HTML and it will go through and make sure each tag is closed. Note this is only tailored to fixing

```opentags.rb -f <file>```
